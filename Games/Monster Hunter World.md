## Reflection
This game is an absolute beast literally and figuratively. I’ve spent countless hours diving into the vibrant ecosystems, taking on towering monsters, and perfecting my non existent builds. The thrill of tracking down a monster, engaging in an intense battle, and finally landing that finishing blow is unmatched.  
The best part for me is how fluid the combat feels. Mastering weapon combos while managing stamina, dodging, and reading a monster's attack patterns creates such a rewarding gameplay loop. I spent a lot of time experimenting with different weapons, but Dual blades became my go-to... I can go spin :)  
Of course, there were moments of frustration getting stun locked by a monster combo is painful. But the satisfaction of learning from my mistakes and finally succeeding makes the challenge worth it. Plus, when all else fails, SoS flares bring a mix of chaos and camaraderie.

## Rating
Fun: 9   *(I love it as long as I don't get stun locked >.<)*  
Difficulty: 5   *(If you are struggling SoS can be a hit or miss!)*  
Replayability: 10   *(Hunt, hunt and hunt!)*  

Please keep in mind that rating of course is a personal score and does not relate to the rating of other players.
