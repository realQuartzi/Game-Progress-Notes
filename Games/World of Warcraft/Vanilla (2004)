# World of Warcraft: Vanilla (2004)

- **Main Class**: Night Elf Hunter
- **Level Reached**: ~34

## Reflection
World of Warcraft’s original release, often referred to as “Vanilla,” was nothing short of groundbreaking for its time. Released in 2004, it set the stage for MMORPGs, creating a persistent, living world that players could immerse themselves in. For me, as a young gamer experiencing it in 2005, it was a magical, formative experience.   
Back then, I was wide-eyed and curious, exploring Azeroth as a Night Elf Hunter named Moonlord. I didn’t fully understand what I was doing, my days were spent fighting raptors in the Wetlands, wandering aimlessly, and marveling at the sheer size of the world. Though I never reached max level or set foot in a raid, the memories of those early days are still etched in my mind. From the mystical forests of Teldrassil to the bustling trade hubs of Stormwind, every corner of Azeroth felt alive and full of possibilities.  
What stood out most in Vanilla was the journey itself. Unlike today’s fast-paced gaming culture, where progression is streamlined, Vanilla encouraged you to savor the experience. Reaching max level could take months, and the world felt vast and untamed. It wasn’t just a game; it was an adventure.

## Rating
Fun: 10
- Vanilla WoW was unlike anything else. The novelty of stepping into Azeroth for the first time, coupled with the slow burn of leveling, made every achievement feel meaningful. Whether it was taming my first pet, crafting my own armor, or simply exploring new zones, everything felt like an accomplishment.  

Dungeon: 10
- Dungeons in Vanilla were epic undertakings. They were lengthy, challenging, and often confusing, but that was part of their charm. I’ll never forget my experiences in Wailing Caverns, where getting lost with my group was as much of an adventure as the battles themselves. Cooperation and patience were essential, and even though I didn’t understand every mechanic back then, the sense of teamwork was exhilarating.  

Raid: NaN  
-  Unfortunately, I didn’t get the chance to raid in Vanilla, as I never reached max level. However, from what I’ve learned over the years, raids like Molten Core and Onyxia’s Lair were monumental, requiring coordination and dedication.

PvE: 10
- Outside of dungeons and raids, the PvE experience was magical. The world itself was the star of the show. Every zone felt unique, from the tranquil forests of Ashenvale to the harsh deserts of Tanaris. The questing system, while sometimes cryptic, encouraged exploration and interaction with other players. The lack of conveniences we take for granted today, like quest addons and flying mounts only added to the immersion.

PvP: NaN
- During Vanilla, I didn’t have the chance to engage in PvP. Without reaching max level and still learning the ropes of the game, PvP was something I didn’t fully experience.
