## Reflection
Jedi: Fallen Order offers a fantastic blend of action, exploration, and Star Wars lore, making it a must-play for fans of the franchise and RPG enthusiasts alike. Despite running the game on the lowest settings, I was impressed by its visuals and how well it immersed me into the Star Wars universe. It felt like stepping into the timeline, and the story integrates beautifully within the broader canon.  
One of the highlights for me was the lightsaber customization though I’m not usually one to fuss over skins, it was fun to tweak my lightsaber for that personal touch. Combat was another strong point, feeling fluid and rewarding, though some fights gave me a real challenge, even on a moderate difficulty (I usually do not use controller... I swear I am good at games). Exploring planets and uncovering secrets was equally satisfying (if not occasionally confusing when trying to find my objective).  
The game strikes a great balance between its narrative, gameplay mechanics, and exploration, making it an enjoyable RPG experience that keeps you hooked from start to finish.  

### Notes
- **Performance:** While my machine struggled to run the game at high settings, I was able to stream it with playable frames on the lowest settings and it still looked amazing.

## Rating
Fun: 8 *(Lightsaber go brrr)*  
Difficulty: 4 *(Harder on harder difficulties... obviously)*  
Replayability: 8 *(Plenty of secrets to find and places to explore)*  

Please keep in mind that rating of course is a personal score and does not relate to the rating of other players.
