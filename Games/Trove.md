## Reflection
Trove, a voxel-based MMORPG, holds a special place in my gaming journey. I first picked up the game shortly after its release, and it quickly became a virtual home. Back then, everything felt possible—through sheer effort and time, you could unlock and achieve practically anything. From being ranked as the second-best Candy Barbarian on the server to managing my own Club (guild), my early days in Trove were filled with excitement, camaraderie, and creativity.  
The endless randomness of world generation was a key highlight, offering an ever-changing playground for exploration and adventure. The ability to build your own Cornerstone (home) and customize it with a vast variety of blocks felt incredibly rewarding. Crafting systems were expansive yet approachable, and had true impact on your characters prowess.  
However, the game changed dramatically with the introduction of the Gem system, marking a turning point for me. While gems brought a new layer of depth to character progression, the grind-heavy mechanics slowly disconnected me from the experience I once loved. Nevertheless, I periodically return to the game, drawn by its charm and the opportunity to explore new content.  
Recently, I decided to start fresh with a new account, pretending to experience Trove as if for the first time. Choosing the Gunslinger class, I set out to grind towards endgame once more. This process of unlocking characters and rediscovering the game felt surprisingly refreshing. It reminded me that even amidst the sweeping changes, Trove retains its core appeal: an inviting world full of creativity, exploration, and endless possibilities.
