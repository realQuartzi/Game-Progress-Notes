## Reflection
Overwatch was a groundbreaking game when it first launched in 2016, offering an unparalleled hero-shooter experience that rivaled games like Team Fortress 2. It wasn’t just a game it was a cultural phenomenon. From the thrill of unlocking skins through free loot boxes to the excitement of learning new heroes every season, Overwatch was a game you could sink hours into every day without getting bored.  
For me, the game was defined by its incredible healer lineup. Starting as a Mercy main, I eventually shifted to Ana, and later enjoyed playing Kiriko when she was added. Each hero felt unique, and learning their quirks and mastering their playstyles was incredibly rewarding.  
Then came Overwatch 2. While it promised to build upon the original’s legacy, many of the changes felt like a step backwards. The removal of loot boxes and the cancellation of PvE content were especially disappointing. It’s still fun in bursts, and I’ve shifted my focus to Zenyatta while continuing to play all the healers. But the magic of the original isn’t quite there anymore.  

## Rating
Fun: 6   *(Was a 10 before PvE was cancelled and lootboxes were removed)*  
Difficulty: 4   *(Pick a good hero and hit your shots >.<)*  
Replayability: 8   *(There will always be new people who can flame you :D)*  

Please keep in mind that rating of course is a personal score and does not relate to the rating of other players.

## Review

### Overview
Overwatch, developed by Blizzard Entertainment, redefined the hero-shooter genre with its vibrant cast of characters, dynamic gameplay, and team-oriented mechanics. When it first launched, it captivated millions with its fresh take on multiplayer FPS games. Overwatch 2, released in 2022, aimed to expand on this success but fell short of expectations in key areas.

### Unique Features of Overwatch
1. **Diverse Hero Roster:** The game features a wide array of heroes, each with unique abilities and roles (Tank, Damage, and Support). This variety encourages experimentation and teamwork.
2. **Team-Based Gameplay:** Success hinges on synergy and communication, making team composition and strategy crucial.
3. **Seasonal Updates:** Regular additions of heroes, maps, and limited-time events kept the game feeling fresh and exciting.
4. **Free Loot Boxes:** Leveling up rewarded players with free loot boxes, making progression feel rewarding without requiring additional purchases.

### The Shift in Overwatch 2
1. **Removal of Loot Boxes:** The shift to a battle pass system replaced the excitement of earning loot boxes with a grindy, monetized progression model.
2. **PvE Content Cancelation:** Overwatch 2’s PvE mode was one of its most anticipated features, and its cancellation left many fans feeling let down.
3. **5v5 Matches:** Reducing team sizes from 6v6 to 5v5 changed the dynamic of matches, leading to faster-paced gameplay but also making certain roles (like Tanks) feel overly impactful or worse, but never right.
4. **Focus on Monetization:** Skins and other cosmetics are now locked behind paywalls, making customization feel less accessible compared to the original.

### Other Enjoyers
Overwatch and Overwatch 2 are great for:
- **Team FPS Enthusiasts:** If you enjoy games that require coordination and strategy, this is for you.
- **Hero-Shooter Fans:** With a diverse roster, there’s a hero for every playstyle.
- **Casual and Competitive Players:** From quick play to ranked matches, there’s something for everyone.
- **Lovers of Stylish Visuals:** Overwatch’s vibrant art style and character designs remain top-notch.

### Conclusion
Overwatch was a game that defined an era of online multiplayer. Its charm, innovation, and community spirit made it a beloved title for millions of players. Overwatch 2, while still enjoyable, feels like a shadow of its predecessor, bogged down by questionable design decisions and missed opportunities.  
There’s still fun to be had, especially if you find a group of friends or a hero you love, but the magic of the original is hard to recapture. As the hero-shooter genre evolves, it will be interesting to see how Overwatch adapts or whether it can reclaim its place at the top.
