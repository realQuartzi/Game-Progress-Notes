## Reflection
This game was so freaking fun. I had a blast.  
The story, combat and characters where all very well developed it was all just a good time. The best part of this game though was for sure that they give you the ability to superguard, I absolutely just abused this mechanic even though (I was told) its only 3 frames of reaction time. I only used this mechanic to defend myself and this definetly made it really fun for me personally trying to superguard every single attack.  
The funnest moment to me was how I solved puzzles. I unintentially solved most puzzle with a totally wrong solution yet was still able to progress through the game this way.  
Other fun moments where definetly related to chats interaction. Them freaking out when I hit superguards on bosses, taking ages to solve puzzles and always annoyed when I for told the future.
