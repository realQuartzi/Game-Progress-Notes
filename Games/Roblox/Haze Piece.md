## Reflection
The time spent playing was enjoyable up until the point where progression no longer felt rewarding.  
Finding your first fruit, unlocking new abilities and beating your first wanna be Gear 5 or Lizard (Dragon) fruit user are all extremely thrilling moments. Consistently watching your level go up and maxing your first stat are one of the greatest achievements one will achieve. Once you reach the point of maxing your main attribute is where progression starts feeling obsolete. This moment occurs close to the point where one would reach the Second Sea. The introduction to the Second Sea was extremely underwhelming, as you are introduced to the exact same leveling and content progression but this time without any noticable progression in power to your character.  
This game also has an interesting amount of P2A (Pay to Access) content such as Gear 5, increased Fruit inventory size and permanent fruits. This P2A is not as intrusive to the average players experience as one might think initially and therefore has not really caused the experience to be less fun to play.  
Lastly this game features some activity rewards, and while the first quick rewards are pretty small compared to the games progression, the later activity rewards are actually quiet substantial to the F2P (Free to Play) player.

## Rating
Fun: 6 *(Very repetative gameplay)*  
Difficulty: 1 *(Smoke fruit lets you 1 combo any enemy in the game)*  
Replayability: 0 *(Leveling once is good enough)*  

Please keep in mind that rating of course is a personal score and does not relate to the rating of other players.
