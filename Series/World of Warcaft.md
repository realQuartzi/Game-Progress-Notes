## Reflection

**[Vanilla](../Games/World%20of%20Warcraft/Vanilla%20(2004)):** The original release of World of Warcraft (WoW), often called "Vanilla," was groundbreaking when it launched in 2004, creating a vast and immersive MMORPG experience. I began playing in 2005 as a Night Elf Hunter named Moonlord, it was a magical and formative time filled with exploration, from battling raptors in the Wetlands to wandering the mystical forests of Teldrassil. Despite never reaching max level or raiding, the journey itself stood out, offering a sense of wonder and adventure. Unlike today’s streamlined gaming, Vanilla’s slow progression and untamed world encouraged players to savor every moment, making the experience unforgettable.
