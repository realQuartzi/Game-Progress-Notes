# Game Progress Notes ðŸŽ®
Welcome to my Game Progress Notes repository! This is where I document my gaming journey, sharing my progress, completion times, and thoughts on the games I've played. Whether you're a fellow gamer, a member of my community, or just curious about my gaming adventures, you're in the right place!

## How It Works
Inside the `Games/` directory, you'll find markdown files for each game/series I've played. These files contain information such as the start date, end date, time to finish, and any additional notes or reflections I have about the game.

## Browse My Progress
Feel free to explore the `Games/` directory to see a list of all the games I've played. Click on any game file to view details about my playthrough, including timestamps and personal insights.
